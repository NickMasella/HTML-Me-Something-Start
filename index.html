               An important first step to any mildly difficult task is to cry about it, and coding is no exception. 
               If you can manage to muster feelings of self doubt and 
               worthlessness this can also be incredibly helpful! Once you've got 
               this step out of the way we can move on to step 2.

            <h1 class="step">Step 2: Begin To Code</h1>

               Figure it out for yourself NERD! If you found a way to read this, good job. You win nothing. Move on to step 3
            </p> 
            <h1 class="step">Step 3: Google</h1>
            <p class="funParagraph">
               If you've reached this step, you're no where close to being finished with your problem.
               <span>Congratulations!</span><br><br>
               Google is incredible and it has all the answers, All hail google! Unfortunately you probably 
               won't be able to understand your search results. So just run your code again for the 60th time 
               and hope something changes. If this fails, which it will, move on to step 4.
            </p>

            <h1 class="step">Step 4: Cry Again</h1>

            <p class="funParagraph">
               At this point you're probably thinking about just throwing in the towel
               and really putting in the effort it takes to solve your problem, But DON'T DO IT! Just cry some more for now.
               Step 5 is just around the corner.

            <h1 class="step">Step 5: Steal Someone Else's Code</h1>
            <p class="funParagraph">
               Delete your spaghetti and copy/paste something from the internet. If you're reading this no doubt someone
               else has already solved your problem.
